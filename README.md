# EXLN Tab - Scoretab UI mod

This is one of my many "EXLN" mods, that aims to decorate the appearance of the player list and inject permission prefixes.

On my project I came across a situation where I wanted to refresh the appearance of the players table.
As it turned out, there are very few such mods, and most importantly, they do not support privileges!
They will not show the player's donation level or his status.

This mod is designed to correct this nuance. It supports the following plugins:
-LuckPerms (for roles)
-PermissionEX (for roles)
- Also supports Spark (for current tps)

Tab is scrollable, and when players won't fit into the main screen, all you have to do is scroll your mouse wheel!

The modification also has its own, non-Minecraft font (Roboto). 

For greater performance I recommend using anti-aliasing

U can setup a lot:
- Should we inject in plugin and take group prefix?
- Should we inject in plugin and take group name instead of prefix?
- If displayed role has some "&2" (colorcodes), should we apply it to text?
- Should we write current TPS?
- Should we paint coloured rounded rectangle for role display?

U can also setup all colors for role display!
